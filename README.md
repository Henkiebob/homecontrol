## CSS
CSS is compiled apart from the webpack task. If you want to compile your scss, do so in the frontend folder with `gulp sass` or `gulp watch`. This will compile automatically to `static/css`

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
** You will need some kind of server to accommodate index.html (You cannot just double-click index.html in your folder)**

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
